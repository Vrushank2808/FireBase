## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vrushank2808/FireBase.git
   cd FireBase
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 14 or higher is recommended). Then, install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application, and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Firebase Integration

This project integrates Firebase to utilize its backend services. To set up Firebase:

1. **Create a Firebase project:**

   - Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. **Add a web app to your Firebase project:**

   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to your project and click on "Add app" to register a new web application. Follow the instructions to obtain your Firebase configuration.

3. **Configure Firebase in your project:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add your Firebase configuration details:

     ```env
     VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
     VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
     VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
     ```

   - Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration details.

4. **Initialize Firebase in your application:**

   - In your `src` directory, create a `firebase.js` file and initialize Firebase:

     ```javascript
     import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';

     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
       authDomain: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
       projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
       storageBucket: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
       messagingSenderId: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
       appId: import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
     };

     const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

     export default app;
     ```

## Build

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist` directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you can use Firebase Hosting:

1. **Install Firebase CLI:**

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase:**

   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase in your project:**

   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

   - Select "Hosting" and follow the prompts to set up your project.

4. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting:**

   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```
